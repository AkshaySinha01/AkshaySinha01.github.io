# India Air Quality Index (AQI) Analytics | 2022–2025

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze India’s Air Quality Index (AQI) trends from 2022–2025 and transform environmental data into stakeholder-focused insights across analytical, executive, and marketing perspectives.

This project moves beyond basic AQI tracking by integrating pollutant severity, health impact analysis, EV adoption comparison, and competitive product positioning.

# 📊 Dashboard Architecture

The solution is structured into three strategic views:

---

## 1️⃣ Consolidated View – Pollution Landscape Analysis

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analytical breakdown of AQI performance across cities and states.

### Key Components:

### 🔹 Top 5 / Bottom 5 Most Polluted Areas
- Dynamic ranking selection
- City-level AQI comparison
- Highlights consistently high-risk zones (e.g., Delhi, Gurugram, Byrnihat)

### 🔹 Monthly AQI Severity Heatmap (Top 10 States)
- Month-wise AQI intensity visualization
- Identifies seasonal pollution spikes
- Enables year-over-year pattern detection

### 🔹 Weekend vs Weekday AQI (Metro Cities)
- Compares pollution variation across activity cycles
- Helps infer traffic & industrial impact

### 🔹 Age Group Vulnerability by AQI Severity
- Categorizes AQI into Severe, Very Poor, Poor
- Highlights demographic exposure risks

### 🔹 Top 2 Pollutants (South India)
- PM2.5 and PM10 dominance across states
- Region-specific pollutant mix insight

### 🔹 Top 5 EV-Adopting States
- EV adoption count comparison
- Enables sustainability-performance correlation

### 🔹 EV vs AQI Comparison
- Compares EV adoption levels with AQI
- Reveals that EV adoption alone does not guarantee cleaner air

---

## 2️⃣ Executive View – Health Impact & Policy Lens

Designed for decision-makers and policy strategists.

### 🔹 Disease Burden vs AQI (Last 3 Years)
- State-wise disease cases (e.g., Acute Diarrheal Disease, Food Poisoning)
- 3-year average AQI comparison
- Identifies correlation between Poor AQI and higher disease burden

### 🔹 Population vs AQI (2024)
- Scatter plot with trend line
- Demonstrates that population size alone does not determine AQI levels
- Mid-population states often show strong pollution-health links

---

### 📌 Executive Insights Identified:

- PM2.5 and PM10 are dominant contributors.
- Pollutant mix impacts health more than city size.
- Poor AQI correlates with higher respiratory and related diseases.
- EV adoption alone is insufficient without industrial and construction control.

---

## 3️⃣ Marketing View – Competitive Positioning

Transforms environmental insights into product strategy.

### 🔹 Air Purifier Competitor Benchmarking
Feature comparison including:
- CADR capacity
- PM2.5 & VOC sensors
- Auto mode
- UV-C light
- Coverage area
- Filter types

### 🔹 Feature Gap Analysis
- Identifies missing smart sensors
- Highlights value differentiation opportunities
